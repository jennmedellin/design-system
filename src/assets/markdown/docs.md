# Specs and docs for reference

The trinity of specs and documentation for guidance in building Covalent apps goes in this order:

## Covalent docs & patterns

## Angular Material docs & demos

## Material Design spec

> Essentially, don't recreate the wheel. Anything you can find in the Covalent or Angular Material docs & demos, you can copy & paste into your app. If you are savvy in Angular best practices, you can create custom components if there is an example in the Material Design spec.
