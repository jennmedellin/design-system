# Filter Options

Filters can be surfaced in a number of ways and there are nuanced differences for use cases.

## Toolbar filters

The primary location for filters should be the main or sub toolbar. Use the main toolbar for global app filters and the sub toolbar for contextual, in-page filters like for a CRUD manage list.

These toolbar filters can be single button toggles (icon or text), multiple button toggles, or icon buttons that trigger right sidesheets.

## Sidenav filters

If the perception to the end users is that they are navigating to a subpage, the manage list sidenav can be used as filters, and appear exactly the same as route navigation.
