# Introduction

> Welcome! This checklist represents the official criteria required to ship an official Teradata product built on Covalent and blessed by the Experience organization.

## The Trifecta of Truth

As a Teradata designer/developer, you must have intimate knowledge of these three things first and foremost.

1. [Material Design Spec](https://material.io/design/)

2. [Angular Material Components](https://material.angular.io/)

3. [Covalent Layouts, Components & Add-ons](https://teradata.github.io/covalent/#/layouts)

### If it doesn't already exist, don't use it

When designing and building your Teradata product or application, if you can't find a solid example from those 3 locations, we strongly recommend not using the design or component. Don't diverge from the spec, don't recreate the wheel, and consult your peers.
